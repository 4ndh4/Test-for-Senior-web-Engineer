Unit Test for Task 1
============================

Please run test.php for testing.


Task 1:

1. Write a script that accepts a positive integer range and, for each increment in the range, prints:
   - "Fizz" if a multiple of 3
   - "Buzz" if a multiple of 5
   - The integer itself otherwise.
   
   E.g. for f[12..16], the output is "Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz 16".

2. Do the same as question 1, except in addition to the previous rules, now it prints "Bazz" instead of an integer 
   after consecutive Fizzes/Buzzes.

  E.g. for f[4..11], the output is “4 Buzz Fizz Bazz 8 Fizz Buzz Bazz”.
